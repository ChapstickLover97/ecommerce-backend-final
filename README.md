  ## Description 

    This is a simple mock-up of what a back-end server might look like and how it would function using sequelize and MySQL

  ## Dependencies  

  MySQL, sequelize

  ## Usage 

  Download the repository and establish a connection via MySQL Workbench or whatever your preferred method is.  Make sure you run "npm run seed" and then "npm run start" in order for it to be live.  For testing in Insomnia, you will have to create your own testing route methods, though you will be able to see the same system that I went through if you watch my description video.
